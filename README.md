# scala-samples
A collection of Scala scripts I wrote while learning and experimenting with the language.

books/
- The scripts in this directory were written while following along with a particular Scala text. If the text contained exercises for the reader, solutions for any exercises I attempted can be found in a subdirectory.

frameworks/
- The scripts in this directory were written to explore the functionality of some library.
